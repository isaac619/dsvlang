**Data Structure Visualizer Language**

DSVLang - Intuitive and uniform declaration structure for all data structures
Structure-Type Name = [values, go, here, for, ALL, data, structures]
Examples:
array myArray = [1,2,3,4]
linked list myLinkedList = [5,6,7,8]

DSVLang generates Two Visualizations After Code Generation.
Image - A PNG file is created, showing all of the data structures at the completion of the code
Video - An MP4 file is created, showing the progression of the creation, and manipulation of data, as well as the line of code in DSVLang that caused the change
